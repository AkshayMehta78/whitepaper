## Abstract

- Digital financing of tangible assets.
- the use of block chain to the center and non-tampering characteristics, the real assets can be anchored in the block chain.
- Issuance of Asset Certificates (Token), provides an open and transparent platform to manage and trade asset certificates (Token).
- Improved Ethereum through Assets Guaranteed Bonds

## Crowdsale Project

[CABS](./tokens/CABS_TOKEN.md): 2017-07-14 to 2017-08-04

## Key Products

- CryptoABS platform
    - Certificate of Assets.
    - Certificate of repayment ability.
    - Provide secondary market transactions.
    - Assist in creating smart contracts with different asset types.
    - Certificate of Assets.
    - audit documents.
    - Signature of regulatory unit (issuer, auditor).
- Crypto Asset-Backed Security
- Every Token has a real asset unit behind it.
- Open Source project
    - Cryptographic Assets Smart Contract Library


## Key Processes

- Construct the CryptoABS platform.
- Build a Proof of Asset service that produces credit ratings for individual Assets.
- the structure of the real assets and Ethereum bridge, with the asset certificate (Token) to replace the physical assets, so that assets through Smart Contract a subsidiary to trade assets.
- Smart Contract Library with various asset types, including Stock, Bonds.
Constructing the Trust Model of Multi - party Participant Supervision.

### Product Life Cycle

### Proof of Assets / Proof of Solvency Process

The asset verification process includes asset verification and repayment capacity review.

### Deploy Smart Contract Process

This platform will help create Smart Contract, identify the subject with asset authentication, and select the template for the different Smart Contract to generate the corresponding Token.

### Transfer Token Process

Token trading process, sub - market trading model

### Interest / Dividend Process

## Proof of Asset / Proof of Solvency / Cryptographic Assets Audit

Asset certification will verify the certification of assets through multi-party units, and only through the asset certification process can be released Smart Contract to Ethereum block chain.
Asset certification information will be placed on IPFS, the establishment of a link with the smart contract to facilitate the inspection at any time.
Repayment capability certification will determine the size of the interest rate and issuance by examining the solvency of the issuer.

### Proof of Asset Participants

Participants are actual companies or units outside the chain.

#### Asset issuer

The CryptoABS platform allows any asset-certified asset issuer to issue assets belonging to its own through the platform to anchor the asset and implement the transaction model through Smart Contract.

#### Independent auditors

The CryptoABS platform has a credit assessment company that can assist asset publishers to verify the value and quantity of assets and assist asset issuers to issue exact quantities of Token.

#### Multi-party trust mechanism

The CryptoABS platform will have a number of independent participants to provide a transparent platform for Cryptographic Assets.

## Smart Contract

Smart contract will provide three templates:
- Bonds
    - Bond-type smart contract, support periodic interest distribution, repayment after maturity.
- Stocks
    - Stock-type smart contract, equity certificate, support dividend payout, allow trading and cash.
- Assets
    - Asset-type smart contract, Token is the asset asset carrier, allowing transactions and cash.

Smart contract will provide de-centric trading function:
- Order book

## Oracle Entities

Communicate with external resources through Oracle concepts to get the same information

## Key Benefits

### Do not need to log in via browser

All asset certification contracts are transparent and transparent through Ethereum for management and verification, using ERC20 interface wallet can be transferred to the Token, and the transaction time is also very short, an average of 15 seconds.

### Transparent asset trading process

The stack of books will automatically save the transaction records.

### Asset vouchers will always exist on the chain

All the assets are recorded in Ethereum, permanent existence.
Even if the CryptoABS platform is closed, each contract that has been generated can be recognized and adopted by the courts in national jurisdictions.

## Conclusion

The CryptoABS platform will provide a transparent, easy-to-audit, secure, intelligent contract platform for all intelligent contracts using Ethereum to centralize the consensus system with IPFS in the block chain implementation of Cryptographic Assets.
